# Project title: 
Get the Middle Letter(s) - Process review exercise.

# Motivation:
I have been tasked at creating a simple tool that will return the middle letter of a word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle letter. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 letters.

- The program runs in a REPL like irb or in a browser console.
- It's fine to use Ruby or JavaScript.
